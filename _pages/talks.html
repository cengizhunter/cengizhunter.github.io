## My Talks & Projects

### Climate App 
An application I developed in FarmOn that calculates the future climate resemblance of different locations. This tool is designed to help determine the similarity between the current climate of a location and the projected climate of another location in the future.

### Talk On School of AI 

I show hands-on machine learning experiments using Google Earth Engine and remote sensing data. You will see wildfire detection and water security analysis examples within this lecture.
