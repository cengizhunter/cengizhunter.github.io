I am a MSc student on Satellite Communication and Remote Sensing program at Istanbul Technical University.
I work as a full-time Geospatial Data Scientist at data driven Agri-Tech company [Doktar](https://www.doktar.com/)
Before, I was a research assistant at [Koç University](https://www.ku.edu.tr/en/), on an ERC project titled [UrbanOccupations](https://urbanoccupations.ku.edu.tr/).

My research interests primarily revolve around machine/deep learning and computer vision, particularly in the context of multi-modal earth observation data. I have a specific focus on utilizing these techniques for environmental conservation purposes. Moreover, I am keen on incorporating explainable machine learning methods into my work to enhance interpretability and transparency.

I am a PhD candidate and Research Assistant in the [Department of Aerospace Engineering](https://www.unibw.de/lrt) of [Bundeswehr University Munich](https://www.unibw.de/home), under the supervision of [Michael Schmitt](https://schmitt-muc.github.io/). 

Before, I was a research assistant at [Koç University](https://www.ku.edu.tr/en/), on an ERC project titled [UrbanOccupations](https://urbanoccupations.ku.edu.tr/). I received my Master’s degree in Satellite Communication and Remote Sensing from [Istanbul Technical University](https://www.itu.edu.tr/en), Turkey in 2021 under the supervision of [Elif Sertel](https://web.itu.edu.tr/~sertele/). 

My research interests focus especially, but not exclusively, on machine/deep learning and computer vision with a particular emphasis on multi-modal earth observation data for _environmental conservation_ using _explainable machine learning_.
