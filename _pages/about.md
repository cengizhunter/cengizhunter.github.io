## [Download My CV](https://github.com/cengizhunter/cengizhunter.github.io/raw/master/_data/cengiz_avci_cv.pdf)

 I am a DataScientist with expertise in geospatial data, computer vision, and remote sensing. I completed my Bachelorâ€™s degree in
 Geomatics Engineering and earnedmyMasterofScienceinSatellite CommunicationandRemoteSensingfromIstanbulTechnical
 University in January 2025. My thesis focused on Transformer and CNNbasedsemanticsegmentationforlanduseanalysis, anda
 conference paper derived from this work hasbeenpublished. Withastrongfoundationin artificial intelligence and a proven track
 record of research, my aimis to applydata-driven technologies to advance both academic inquiry and industry practice, with
 particular emphasis on addressing climate-related challenges and contributing to global sustainability

## My Talks & Projects

### Talk On School of AI 

I show hands-on machine learning experiments using Google Earth Engine and remote sensing data. You will see #wildfire detection and #watersecurity analysis examples within this lecture.

### Climate App 
An application I developed while I was working as a ML Intern at  [FarmOn](https://www.farmonapp.com/) that calculates the future climate resemblance of different locations. This tool is designed to help determine the similarity between the current climate of a location and the projected climate of another location in the future.
