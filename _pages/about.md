This is my last semester as a Geomatics Engineering student at [Istanbul Technical University](https://www.itu.edu.tr/en/homepage). I am focused
on fields such as geospatial data analysis and computer vision for obtaining valuable information from the satellite imagery. I make my machine learning & remote sensing studies on Google Earth Engine platform. I am  currently working on the road extraction topic as a Research Fellow at [Urban Occupations](https://urbanoccupations.ku.edu.tr/) OETR project. I also work part time as Junior Data Analyst at [Doktar](https://www.doktar.com/en) Agri Tech Company. I want to build my career on AI and Remote Sensing related fields and make beneficial actions for the only earth we live in against the climate change. 

My Projects 
======
I did my graduation thesis with Pytorch to make an [Automatic Building Segmentation from High Resolution Satellite Imagery](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1y5zl_lb5gONORVb9LQuFXYMcgf5l9HZFpDx94-e-MjU/edit#slide=id.p) under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Elif Sertel](https://web.itu.edu.tr/~sertele/) .

I made a presentation about Remote Sensing and Machine Learning algorithms on Google Earth Engine which are useful for climate related studies.
[Google Earth Engine & ML & Remote Sensing & Climate Talk on School Of AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-fM9ST2PjI&t=511s&ab_channel=BerilSirmacek)


âš¡ I also make video edits for the movies which I like for my youtube channel.
