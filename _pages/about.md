I am a MSc student on Satellite Communication and Remote Sensing program at Istanbul Technical University.
I work as a full-time Geospatial Data Scientist at data driven Agri-Tech company [Doktar](https://www.doktar.com/)
Before, I was a research assistant at [Koç University](https://www.ku.edu.tr/en/), on an ERC project titled [UrbanOccupations](https://urbanoccupations.ku.edu.tr/).

My research interests primarily revolve around machine/deep learning and computer vision, particularly in the context of multi-modal earth observation data. I have a specific focus on utilizing these techniques for environmental conservation purposes. Moreover, I am keen on incorporating explainable machine learning methods into my work to enhance interpretability and transparency.

## My Talks & Projects

### Climate App 
An application I developed in FarmOn that calculates the future climate resemblance of different locations. This tool is designed to help determine the similarity between the current climate of a location and the projected climate of another location in the future.

### Talk On School of AI 

I show hands-on machine learning experiments using Google Earth Engine and remote sensing data. You will see #wildfire detection and #watersecurity analysis examples within this lecture.
