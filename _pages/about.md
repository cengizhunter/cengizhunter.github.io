## [Download My CV](https://github.com/cengizhunter/cengizhunter.github.io/raw/master/_data/Cengiz_Avci_CV_June2024.pdf)

I am a Geomatics Engineer currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Satellite Communication and Remote Sensing at Istanbul
Technical University, which I will be completing in July 2024. My thesis focuses on transformer-based semantic segmentation
models. My professional experience includes roles as a Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, and Research Assistant, where I
applied deep learning algorithms to a variety of tasks such as agricultural boundary delineation, land use/land cover
segmentation, and road extraction from historical maps. I possess a strong skill set in Python, PyTorch, and a wide range of deep
learning tools. Additionally, I have extensive experience with implementing state-of-the-art Hugging Face models. My research has
been published in reputable journals, reflecting my commitment to advancing the field of data science.

## My Talks & Projects

### Talk On School of AI 

I show hands-on machine learning experiments using Google Earth Engine and remote sensing data. You will see #wildfire detection and #watersecurity analysis examples within this lecture.

### Climate App 
An application I developed while I was working as a ML Intern at  [FarmOn](https://www.farmonapp.com/) that calculates the future climate resemblance of different locations. This tool is designed to help determine the similarity between the current climate of a location and the projected climate of another location in the future.
