I am focused on fields such as geospatial data analysis and computer vision for obtaining valuable information from the satellite
imagery. 
I graduated as a Geomatics Engineer and started my master’s degree in Satellite Communication and Remote Sensing
program at Istanbul Technical University under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Elif Sertel](https://web.itu.edu.tr/~sertele/)
